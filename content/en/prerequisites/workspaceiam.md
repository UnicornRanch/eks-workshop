{{% notice info %}}
Cloud9 normally manages IAM credentials dynamically. This isn't currently compatible with
the aws-iam-authenticator plugin, so we will disable it and rely on the IAM role instead.

- Return to your workspace and click the sprocket, or launch a new tab to open the Preferences tab
- Select **AWS SETTINGS**
- Turn off **AWS managed temporary credentials**
- Close the Preferences tab

- To ensure temporary credentials aren't already in place we will also remove
any existing credentials file:
```
rm -vf ${HOME}/.aws/credentials
```

- We should configure our aws cli with our current region as default:
```
export AWS_REGION=$(curl -s 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | jq -r .region)
echo "export AWS_REGION=${AWS_REGION}" >> ~/.bash_profile
aws configure set default.region ${AWS_REGION}
aws configure get default.region
```
